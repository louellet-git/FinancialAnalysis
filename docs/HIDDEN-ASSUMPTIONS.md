# Hidden assumptions and landmines — the trap registry

Non-obvious assumptions an agent can trip on. Each entry carries an evidence pointer;
every entry below was re-verified against the code/docs on 2026-07-17. If you find a new
one, add it here with a pointer.

## Data layer

**1. Recast-financials landmine (IBM FY2019–20).** The store mixes continuing-ops
(recast) revenue with unrecast consolidated OCF across the Kyndryl divestiture boundary,
so the FY2020 "28.2% FCF margin" is spurious and **margin windows longer than 5 years
are unusable** for IBM until the importer aligns recasts. The backtest surfaces (never
fixes) this via `DATA_FLAGS`; every realized IBM vintage window touches a flagged year.
Evidence: `analysis/IBM/README.md` §Data notes; `financial_analysis/backtest.py:62-69`
(`DATA_FLAGS`); `analysis/IBM/REVIEW.md` F13; commit `8153323` (IBM backtest bias driven
by the recast).

**2. Phantom "10-K" rows.** The importer keys periods off *any* mapped concept's period
end, so stray XBRL facts create annual rows with 1–2 fields and no revenue/OCF (IBM:
2012-06-30, 2018-01-01, 2019-01-01 — the latter two also have `filed_date` equal to
`period_end`, the importer's placeholder). They carry no FCF and never enter the DCF
engines, but any code iterating `company.periods` naively will hit them.
`backtest._clean_annuals` filters them by requiring revenue AND OCF. Evidence:
`financial_analysis/importer.py:149-160` (row creation), `:154` (filed_date
placeholder); `financial_analysis/backtest.py:76-94`; `tests/test_backtest.py:77`;
`analysis/IBM/README.md:91`.

**3. `n_periods=8` is per-concept, not per-company.** `extract_series` returns the last
8 entries *per concept*; the union of period-ends across ~60 concepts yields far more
than 8 periods (IBM: 22 annual rows), with older rows only partially populated (e.g.
IBM buybacks populated FY2012–19 while revenue is None before FY2018). Do not treat
older rows as complete statements. Evidence: `financial_analysis/importer.py:120,146`;
`financial_analysis/xbrl_api.py:74` (`[-n:]`).

**4. Filed-date visibility lag (point-in-time honesty).** For companyfacts-sourced
data, `filed_date` is the date of the filing the figure was *drawn from* — usually a
LATER 10-K's comparative column, because deduplication keeps the latest-filed entry per
end date (IBM FY2019 carries filed 2022-02-22; FY2023 carries 2026-02-24). The backtest
filters vintages on `filed_date <= as_of`, so vintages are **conservative** (see fewer
periods than a real-time observer), never optimistic — the safe leakage direction, but
do not read `filed_date` as "when this became public." Evidence:
`financial_analysis/backtest.py:1-37` (module docstring, caveat #1);
`financial_analysis/xbrl_api.py:25-32` (`_deduplicate`);
`financial_analysis/importer.py:97-117`.

**5. Segment data is hand-entered; companyfacts has no segment axis.** The SEC
companyfacts API strips dimensional facts (verified across every us-gaap concept in
IBM's payload: entries carry exactly `{accn, end, filed, form, fp, frame, fy, start,
val}`), so `PeriodFinancials.segment_revenue` is always None from that source. IBM's
per-segment revenue in `analysis/IBM/driver_model.py:24-29` (`SEGMENT_HISTORY`) is
hand-entered from the Jan 28, 2026 Q4 8-K ("Other" $63M dropped, 0.1% of revenue).
Filing-level instance-document extraction is Ticket 7. Evidence:
`financial_analysis/importer.py:1-14`; `PLANNING/tickets.md` Ticket 7;
`financial_analysis/schema.py:152-156`.

**6. The JSON store holds statements only — no prices, options, or estimates.**
`store.save()` serializes `periods` exclusively; market data attached by
`scripts/analyze.py` lives only in the xlsx and in dated snapshots under
`data/raw/TICKER/` (options/, estimates/, prices.json). IBM's JSON `prices` array is
empty; the report's price/dividend/analyst-target figures were **hand-entered** from
cited sources, not pipeline outputs (disclosed). Evidence:
`financial_analysis/store.py:38-44`; `analysis/IBM/README.md:93`;
`analysis/IBM/report/SOURCE-AUDIT.md` row 43.

**7. Capex sign convention.** The importer stores capex sign-flipped (negative);
`free_cash_flow = OCF − abs(capex)`. A 2026-06-12 bug overstated FCF by 2×capex before
the abs() fix — do not "simplify" it away. Evidence: `financial_analysis/schema.py:161-167`;
`financial_analysis/xbrl_tags.py:106-109` (`sign_flip=True`); `context.json`
`fcf_sign_note`; `PLANNING/tickets.md` Ticket 5 results.

**8. `dividends_paid` third fallback is dividends DECLARED, not paid.**
`us-gaap/DividendsCommonStockCash` is an equity charge used as a last-resort proxy when
neither payments concept exists for a period (first-wins merging). Fine for steady
payers; wrong for irregular ones. Evidence: `financial_analysis/xbrl_tags.py:128-138`
(inline precedence comment).

**9. yfinance surfaces are current-only; history accumulates from first pull.** Option
chains and forward consensus estimates have no free historical endpoint — each pull is
persisted as a dated snapshot (one per calendar day; same-day re-run reads disk,
`--refresh` overwrites). If you never ran a ticker, there is no history to load.
Evidence: `financial_analysis/options.py:1-8`, `financial_analysis/estimates.py:1-14`
(module docstrings).

## Model layer (IBM v4 / driver engine)

**10. Buybacks are genuinely absent from the model — not an omission bug.** IBM's
share count is held FLAT (948,675,228 diluted) because SBC is charged as a full cash
cost — also growing the count would double-charge dilution (REVIEW F5). The store's
null `repurchases_common_stock` for FY2020+ mirrors reality (IBM's buybacks stopped;
the mapping itself works — FY2012–19 values are populated) and the source audit
verified the nulls. Capital-return arithmetic in the analysis treats dividends + M&A as
the (debt-funded) return channel. Evidence: `analysis/IBM/driver_model.py:32`
(`SHARES ... held flat (SBC charged in margin)`); `analysis/IBM/REVIEW.md` F5, F13;
`analysis/IBM/report/IBM-valuation-2026-07.md:155`; `SOURCE-AUDIT.md` row 43.

**11. f-conditionality: every headline number is conditional on f = 0.50.** The M&A
recurrence judgment `f` charges f × M&A spend in the margin AND credits f × acquired
growth in `g_software`'s mean — a paired judgment with a single source of truth
(`MA_RECURRENCE`, guarded by a module-level assert so the two legs cannot drift apart).
Changing one leg without the other silently breaks pairing coherence. The f-locus
(0→1, growth credit moving WITH f) is published by `dcf_drivers_run.py`; f is a
judgment, not a fitted parameter. Evidence: `analysis/IBM/driver_model.py:36-43,
161-171, 240-244`; `analysis/IBM/DRIVER-REVIEW.md` ma_recurrence row.

**12. "Tails are decorative."** Each path holds one growth draw for all ten years (no
mean reversion — ticket T-DCF-1, the largest known distortion), so the left tail is
understated even after the v4 correlation matrix fattened it. Standing language: "P50s
are robust; P10s are optimistic. No margin-of-safety claim is made from these tails."
Do not quote P10/P90 as decision-grade. Evidence:
`analysis/IBM/report/IBM-valuation-2026-07.md:99` (tail-caveat callout);
`analysis/IBM/REVIEW.md:54` (T-DCF-1: "Until then, P10/P90 are decorative");
`financial_analysis/driver_dcf.py:43-45` (disclosed limitation).

**13. The scenarios registry still carries IBM v3 values while the engine moved to
v4 — verified still true on 2026-07-17, and deliberate.**
`financial_analysis/scenarios.py:51-78` (`_ibm_v3`, `_SCENARIO_OVERRIDES["IBM"]`,
`CAPITAL_OVERRIDES["IBM"]`) encodes the v3 aggregate framework (base P50 $141 family:
g 2.15%, WACC 7.5%, margin 14.5%). The current v4 headline (P50 $151.84, conditional on
f=0.50) exists ONLY in `analysis/IBM/driver_model.py` + `driver_dcf.py`. The visualizer
runs both, in separate labeled sections ("Aggregate DCF scenarios" vs "Driver-based
model"). Net debt ($54.0B) and shares (948.7M) agree across both. If you read
`scenarios.py` for "the IBM valuation," you get v3. Evidence: files cited;
`scripts/visualize_dcf.py:72-78` (`SECTION_TITLES`), `:837` (`_driver_compare_figure`).

**14. Truncation is clip-after-correlation.** `truncnorm` drivers are clipped to
[lo, hi] AFTER the correlated transform — not a true truncated normal: mass piles on the
bounds and realized correlations distort. Second-order for mild truncations; check no
bound sits within ~2σ of its mean (g_infrastructure's hi=+3% sits at 1.6σ — the bound
mass is disclosed in DRIVERS.md). Evidence: `financial_analysis/driver_dcf.py:20-30`
(module docstring); `analysis/IBM/DRIVERS.md` driver table.

**15. The two engines guard degenerate terminal values differently.** Classic engine:
`np.clip(wacc − tg, 0.001, None)` — near-degenerate paths CAN dominate its tails (F12).
Driver engine: joint guard `tg_eff = min(tg, wacc − 0.02)` with the pinned fraction
reported. Do not assume classic-engine tail output has the driver engine's protections.
Evidence: `financial_analysis/dcf.py:138`; `financial_analysis/driver_dcf.py:405-431`;
`analysis/IBM/REVIEW.md` F12/T-DCF-2.

**16. Classic-engine minimum-history guard.** `StochasticDCF` raises unless ≥ 4 annual
periods have positive FCF (blocks post-IPO/loss-makers); the backtest requires ≥ 3
usable periods per vintage and records skips. Evidence:
`financial_analysis/dcf.py:10,77-88`; `financial_analysis/backtest.py:52,150-155`.

## Pipeline/repo layer

**17. The xlsx always has nine sheets; the console tab count lies by omission.**
`write_xlsx` creates every sheet regardless of flags; `--no-market` etc. just leave
header-only sheets, while the "Done: ... across N tabs" message counts populated groups.
Evidence: `scripts/analyze.py:70-81, 279-284, 370-379`.

**18. Tracked-but-gitignored churn.** `data/processed/NVDA_financials.xlsx` and
`data/processed/PANW_financials.xlsx` are tracked in git although `data/processed/` is
gitignored — running the pipeline dirties them. Never commit those changes (candidate
fix: `git rm --cached`). Evidence: `git ls-files data/`; `.gitignore`;
`PLANNING/HANDOFF.md` §Known state.

**19. RPO rows hide on the Balance Sheet tab.** `remaining_performance_obligation` is a
disclosure fact but is written to the Balance Sheet tab with `statement="disclosure"`
(no dedicated tab). Its current/noncurrent duration split is text-only in filings and
is not extracted. Evidence: `scripts/analyze.py:51-58` (`_TAB_FOR`);
`financial_analysis/xbrl_tags.py:147-155`.

**20. Default scenario presets are generic mature-large-cap.** `DEFAULT_SCENARIOS`
(bear 1%/base 4%/bull 6% growth) applies to ANY ticker without an override — running
`visualize_dcf` on a hypergrowth name silently produces mature-large-cap scenario
labels and assumptions. Net-debt derivation also reads short-term borrowings from
`raw_extras` keys and treats absence as 0. Evidence:
`financial_analysis/scenarios.py:45-49, 92-125`.
